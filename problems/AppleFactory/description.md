# Apple Factory

The apple factory had a mixup when ordering labels, and now they are left with a whole bunch of letters they don't need in the wrong order. Your boss needs to know how many apple baskets can be marked by salvaging the labels you do have.

Given a **string as input**, you need to **return an integer** representing the number of times that the word **apple** can be spelled using each character a single time.

## Input
As input, you will receive a single string of lowercase letters and other characters.
```
<string>
```

## Output
As output, you will give a single integer representing the number of times the word apple can be spelled.
```
<integer>
```

## Constraints
* String input will never exceed 100,000 characters in length
* All alphabetical characters will be lowercase
* Whitespace and other special characters are valid input

## Examples

### Input 0

### Output 0
1

### Input 1
banana

### Output 1
0

### Input 2
